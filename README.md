**This project is no longer under development. The codebase is extrememly out of date and requires a ground-up rewrite. No further features will be added, and no PRs will be merged in.**
I truly appreciate the response this application got, but I chose poorly when it came to the language/framework. Using Angular2 when it was just starting out and thus quite volatile and open to change wans't a smart move. As such, most of the code is now either deprecated or requires updates. I unfortunately don't have the time to do this.


# Clarkson

Clarkson is a web-based dashboard application that gives you a neat and clean interface for logging your fuel fill-ups for all of your vehicles. The application has full multi-user support, as well as multiple vehicles per user. Whenever you fill-up your car or motorcycle, keep the receipt and record the data in Clarkson.

## Features

- Dashboard giving you high-level statistics on your vehicle fill-ups, including:
  - Total spent on fill-ups on all your vehicles
  - Total distance traveled
  - Graphs showing fuel consumption trends
- Add/edit/remove an unlimited number of vehicles
  - Include basic information such as Make, Model, Registration, VIN, Fuel Type
- Add/edit/remove fuel fill-ups
  - Total cost or unit cost will be automatically calculated as you enter the data
  - Include any notes
  - Inform the app whether or not the fill-up was to the top (full tank), or if you missed any previous fill-ups
- Choose your units - available settings:
  - Fuel Units: Litres, Gallons, or US Gallons
  - Consumption Units: MPG, L/100KM
  - Distance Units: Miles, Kilometres
  - Currency Units: GBP, USD, EUR, AUD, CAD

## Running the application

Clarkson has an Angular front-end, with ExpressJS backend, connecting to a MySQL database (Supported version v5.7.*). It uses Flyway as a means of managing incremental migrations of the database schema.

#### Get the dependencies

To get the application running, you'll need `node` and `npm` installed. Firstly, install the angular-cli (plus ts dependencies):

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli ts-node typescript
```

Then grab all of the dependencies for the app itself:

```bash
npm install
```

#### Set up the frontend config

Depending on how you run the application, you'll need to update the `src/environments/environment.prod.ts` file so the frontend points to the right server URL:

```typescript
export const environment = {
    production: true,
    apiBaseUrl: 'https://your-domain-here/api' // or use 'http://<local_network_ip>:3000' if not behind a reverse proxy
};
```

#### Build

Once you're happy with the endpoint in config, build the frontend:

```bash
ng build --prod
```

This will create a `dist/` directory, which is where the frontend gets served.

#### Migrate the database

Before you run the application, you'll need to run a database migration using _flyway_. This will create the schema and initial tables/procedures that are used by Clarkson. To do this, run:

```bash
./flyway/flyway -user=<mysql_user> -password=<mysql_user> -schemas=clarkson -url=jdbc:mysql://<mysql_host_ip> migrate
```

**Note**: The `-user`, `-password` and `-url` values must match those that you use when running the application (see below).

**JRE**: Flyway is a Java tool, so requires the JRE to be available in `$PATH`. It is not packaged as part of this application due to variations in OS requirements.

#### Start the app

Finally, start the application by running:

```bash
MYSQL_HOST=<mysql_host_ip> MYSQL_USERNAME=<mysql_user> MYSQL_PASSWORD=<mysql_user> ENABLE_REGISTRATIONS=true APP_PORT=3000 node clarkson.js
```

Environment variables at startup:

| Env | Required? | Used for |
| --- | --------- | -------- |
| MYSQL_HOST | _Yes_ | Points the backend to the MySQL database |
| MYSQL_USERNAME | _Yes_ | The user with access to the _clarkson_ schema |
| MYSQL_PASSWORD | _Yes_ | The password for the user |
| ENABLE_REGISTRATIONS | _No_ | **Defaults to _false_**. If set to _true_, allows new users to register |
| APP_PORT | _No_ | **Defaults to 3000**. Changes the running port of the application |
